# 🎧 Headphones - Responsive Landing Page

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Curriculum** and focuses on building a responsive landing page using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, based on a detailed Figma design.

## 🚀 Objective

Recreate a professional and modern **headphones landing page** that is fully responsive and visually aligned with the provided Figma file.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Responsive Web Design

## 🎨 Figma Design

To access and inspect the original design:

1. [Open the Figma Project](#)
2. Click on **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to save a copy and gain full access.
3. If you face issues accessing the file, try using this backup link: [Figma File](#)

> **Fonts Required:**
>
> - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
> - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle)

If these fonts are missing from your system, please install them to match the design accurately.

## 📱 Responsiveness

The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile Version**: Activates when screen width is **480px or less**
- **Max Content Width**: 1000px and centered on large screens

## 🖱️ Interactions

- **Link hover/active color**: `#FF6565`
- **Button hover/active effect**: `opacity: 0.9`

## 💡 Notes

- Some margin/padding values from Figma may be in float (e.g., `12.8px`). You may **round these values** for simplicity.
- Use **semantic HTML elements** and maintain clean, readable code.

## ✅ Requirements

- Must follow the Figma design closely
- Fully responsive layout
- Clean and validated HTML/CSS
- Font styles and sizes must reflect the design
